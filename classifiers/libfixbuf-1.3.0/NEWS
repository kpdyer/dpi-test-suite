Bug Fixes

Version 1.0.1: 2011-06-01
============================

Fix to maintain compatibility with GLib prior to version 2.10

Version 1.0.0: 2011-04-28
=============================

Added functionality to adhere to the proposed IPFIX extension: "Export of Structured Data in IPFIX".  This proposed standard allows for the following three new data types.

Added new data type: fbBasicList_t to house fixbuf "basicLists."

Added new data type: fbSubTemplateList_t to house fixbuf "subTemplateLists."

Added new data type: fbSubTemplateMultiList_t to house fixbuf "subTemplateMultiLists."

Added the functionality to handle multiple listeners, allowing for connections on multiple ports.

Support for Netflow V9.

Spread support has been expanded to allow for greater flexibility in using one exporter to publish to multiple groups.

Templates are now managed on a per-group basis for a Spread exporter.

Templates can now be multicasted to select Spread groups.

Default Automatic Mode for Listeners is now set to true.

Many other bug fixes.

Version 0.9.0: 2010-07-27
==============================

Added support for Spread Toolkit to allow publish subscribe distribution of YAF sensor output. 

Version 0.8.0: 2008-09-09
=================================

Addition of NetFlow v9 input translation on network connections.  NetFlow v9
only works as a collector (listener) and only over UDP.  (Most of those
limitations are related to the nature of the NetFlow protocol itself.)  


Version 0.7.2: 2008-01-18
=================================

Minor build system change required to fix multithreaded fixbuf collection 
issues with skipfix in SiLK 0.11.9 and later.

Version 0.7.1: 2007-09-28
===================================

Fixes encoding errors of octet array information elements on little-endian 
machines.

Version 0.7.0: 2007-08-17
================================

Fixes alignment issues on Solaris/SPARC; cross-platform build enhancements;
support for - as stdin/stdout filename; partial flexible stream selection 
support; true biflow reverse PEN support. 

Version 0.6.0: 2007-05-17
=============================

libfixbuf 0.6.0 completely reorganizes the API to recenter it around an
IPFIX Message Buffer object. It adds new, more flexible interfaces to lower
level transport for building IPFIX Collecting and Exporting Processes,
including a select()-based listener interface for multi-session
collectors; support for SCTP and TLS over TCP as transport protocols;
and support for reverse PEN based bidirectional flow export as in 
draft-ietf-ipfix-biflow-03. Storage of IPFIX Messages in files is supported,
but the final message and final set support as in revision -00 of 
draft-trammell-ipfix-file has been removed.

This release also renames all the calls and data structures to be in line
with the conventions used in the NetSA SiLK codebase, and is therefore
completely incompatible with previous releases; applications
must be rewritten to use fixbuf 0.6.0.

Version 0.5.0: 2006-09-29
===================================

libfixbuf 0.5.0 splits the API into application programming interface and 
transport programming interface, and adds new transport layers for TCP, UDP, 
and files.

Version 0.4.1: 2006-07-07
=============================

libfixbuf 0.4.1 adds a new Information Element for YAF 0.1.6.

Version 0.4.0: 2006-06-16
===============================

libfixbuf 0.4.0 is a bugfix and feature enhancement release. 
The FixSession structure has been removed, to store templates per 
FixReader or FixWriter instance. This was done to support per-session 
(transient) scoping of template IDs. This is an incompatible API change; 
fixbuf applications will have to be updated to use the new 0.4.0 API.

Version 0.3.2: 2006-03-17
===============================

libfixbuf 0.3.2 is a bugfix release. Transcode plan caching now works properly.

Version 0.3.1: 2006-03-14
===============================

libfixbuf 0.3.1 is a bugfix and feature enhancement release. Support now exists
for full template table export, to comply with periodic template export
requirements in the IPFIX protocol. Reduced-length information element encoding
is now supported, as well, with full transcoder support for transcoding between
identical information elements of different arbitrary lengths.

Version 0.3.0: 2006-02-03
=================================

libfixbuf 0.3.0 adds an information element registry, changing the way that
information elements are programmatically added to templates. New information
elements have been added to support YAF. Also new is FixVarfield, a much more
usable interface for transcoding variable-length information elements.
Variable-length transcoding support has been completely rewritten and tested.
fixport and fixcollect have been removed; the upcoming YAF IPFIX export and
collection facility will take their place. Corner-case bugs in the writer and 
transcoder have been fixed as well.

Version 0.2.0: 2006-01-06
================================

libfixbuf 0.2.0 is a redesign of the libfixbuf API, renaming most calls. 
It adds MTU support for splitting record streams into multiple messages, 
built-in UDP export and collection support. Two new applications, fixport and
fixcollect, are now provided for UDP export and collection. Additionally, this 
version modifies the API for handling private enterprise information
elements, and adds new CERT private enterprise information elements for
biflow support in NAF 0.4.2.

Version 0.1.1: 2005-11-18
=================================

libfixbuf 0.1.1 is a bugfix release, fixing a read buffer reset bug that 
kept libfixbuf from reading multiple messages with the same reader.

Version 0.1.0: 2005-10-31
=================================

libfixbuf 0.1.0 splits its session template table into "read" and "write"
sides, to avoid template number space collisions when writing IPFIX filters
using libfixbuf. It also splits calls to its low-level I/O functions to
support future UDP and SCTP low-level I/O for IPFIX compliance. Alpha quality
warnings still apply, though the API should be settling down soon.

Version 0.0.7: 2005-10-03
================================

libfixbuf 0.0.7 extends the FloCON preview release with Options Template
Set support, (still untested but otherwise complete) variable-length
information element support, and a few new information elements to support 
NAF 0.0.7. The library is still undocumented, and should still be considered
alpha-quality.

Version 0.0.3: 2005-09-16
===================================

libfixbuf 0.0.3 is the FloCON Developers' Preview Release of
libfixbuf. This revision of libfixbuf is a partial implementation of
the IPFIX protocol message format (as of September 2005) with support
for long messages and sets as outlined in IETF individual draft
draft-trammell-ipfix-file-00. Important features are missing, including:

* Options Template Set support

* Variable-length information element support (partial, untested)

In addition, the API for this version is not documented, because it
will change. Specificially:

* Sessions support for information element registries, including type
  information for each information element number. This will allow
  libfixbuf to handle endian conversion, among other things.

* Transcoder support for information element value
  translation within the context of a message; e.g. relative to
  absolute flow times, flow times to time and duration, etc.

* Any other commentary received on API usability during or after
  FloCON will be considered, and identified issues addressed.

See the README file for more on using libfixbuf.
