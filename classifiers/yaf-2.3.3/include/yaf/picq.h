 *
 * Generic Pickable Queue. A pickable queue's elements may be removed from any
 * point in the queue, and added to the queue's head or tail. Together with a
 * hash table to locate mid-queue elements, this can be used to implement idle
 * timeout of its elements.
 *
 * Where present, a <tt>vq</tt> argument is a void pointer to a queue. A
 * queue's first two members must be a pointer to the tail (last node) of the
 * queue and a pointer to the head (first node) of the queue.
 *
 * Where present, a <tt>vn</tt> argument is a void pointer to a queue node.
 * A queue node's first two elements must be a pointer to the previous node
 * in the queue and a pointer to the next node in the queue.
