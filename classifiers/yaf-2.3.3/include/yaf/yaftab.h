/*
 * This is the documentation for the _old_ yaftab.h; it is no longer current,
 * and should not be read by anyone.
 *
 * Flow generation interface for YAF. This facility works by maintaining a
 * current flow table. Packets may be added to the active flows within this
 * table using the yfFlowPkt() call. Completed flows may be written to an
 * IPFIX message buffer using yfFlowFlush().
 *
 * The flow table is configured by a number of global variables.
 *
 * <tt>yaf_idle</tt> sets
 * the idle timeout in seconds. A flow that receives no packets for the idle
 * timeout is assumed to be complete. The idle timeout is set to 300 seconds
 * (five minutes) by default.
 *
 * <tt>yaf_active</tt> sets the active timeout in seconds.
 * The maximum duration of a flow is the active timeout; additional packets
 * for the same flow will be counted as part of a new flow. The active timeout
 * is set to 1800 seconds (half an hour) by default.
 *
 * <tt>yaf_flowlim</tt> sets the maximum size of the flow table; flows exceeding
 * this limit will be expired in least-recent order, as if they were idle. The
 * flow limit defaults to zero, for no limit. Use this global to limit resource
 * usage by the flow table.
 *
 * <tt>yaf_paylen</tt> sets the number of bytes of payload to capture from the
 * start of each flow. The payload length defaults to zero, which disables
 * payload capture.
 *
 * <tt>yaf_uniflow</tt>, if TRUE, exports flows in uniflow mode, using the
 * record adjacency export method described in section 3 of
 * draft-ietf-ipfix-biflow. Defaults to FALSE.
 *
 * <tt>yaf_macmode</tt>, if TRUE, exports layer 2 information with each flow;
 * presently this is limited to VLAN tags but may be expanded to include the
 * MPLS stack and MAC addresses in the future. Defaults to FALSE.
 *
 * <tt>yaf_silkmode</tt>, if TRUE, enables SiLK compatibility mode. In this
 * mode, totalOctetCount and reverseTotalOctetCount are clamped to 32 bits.
 * Any packet that would cause either of these counters to overflow 32 bits
 * will force an active timeout. The high-order bit of the flowEndReason IE
 * is set on any flow created on a counter overflow, as above, or on an active
 * timeout. Defaults to FALSE.
 *
 * <tt>yaf_reqtype</tt> limits the flow table to collecting IPv4 or IPv6 flows
 * only. Set to YF_TYPE_IPv4 for IPv4 flows only, YF_TYPE_IPv6 for IPv6 flows
 * only, or YF_TYPE_IPANY (the default) to collect both IPv4 and IPv6 flows.
 *
 * This facility is used by YAF to assemble packets into flows.

/**
 *yfFlowTabAlloc
 *
 * Allocate a flow table.
 *
 * @param idle_ms   idle timeout in milliseconds. A flow that receives no
 *                  packets for the idle timeout is assumed to be complete.
 * @param active_ms active timeout in milliseconds. The maximum duration of a
 *                  flow is the active timeout; additional packets
 *                  for the same flow will be counted as part of a new flow.
 * @param max_flows maximum number of active flows. Flows exceeding this limit
 *                  will be expired in least-recent order, as if they were idle.
 *                  Used to limit resource usage of a flow table. A value of 0
 *                  disables flow count limits.
 * @param max_payload   maximum octets of payload to capture per flow direction.
 *                      Requires at least max_payload octets of payload to be
 *                      available in each packet buffer passed to yfFlowPBuf().
 *                      A value of 0 disables payload capture and export.
 * @param uniflow   If TRUE, export biflows using record adjacency (two uniflows
 *                  exported back-to-back. Use this for interoperability with
 *                  IPFIX collectors that do not implement RFC 5103.
 * @param silkmode  If TRUE, clamp totalOctetCount and maxTotalOctetCount to 32
 *                  bits and force active timeout on overflow. Set high order
 *                  bit in flowEndReason for each flow created on an overflow
 *                  or active timeout. Breaks IPFIX interoperability; use for
 *                  direct export to SiLK rwflowpack or flowcap.
 *
 * @param macmode   If TRUE, collect and export source and destination Mac
                    Addresses.
 * @param applabelmode If TRUE, then the payload, (as limited by max_payload,)
 *                     is sent through various plugins and code in order to
 *                     determine which protocol is running on the flow by doing
 *                     only payload inspection and exporting payload relevent
 *                     information.
 *
 * @param entropymode  If TRUE, then a Shannon Entropy measurement is made over
 *                     the captured payload (as limited by max_payload).  The
 *                     entropy value is exported as two values one for forward
 *                     payload and one for reverse payload.
 *
 * @param fingerprintmode If TRUE, then this will enable passive OS finger printing
 *                      using the p0f engine based mostly on TCP negotiation
 *
 *
 * @param fpExportMode  If TRUE, then this will enable exporting of full
 *                      packet banners of the TCP negotiations for the first
 *                      three packets (including IP
 *                      and transport headers) for external fingerprinting
 *
 * @param udp_max_payload  If TRUE, then this will enable capturing up to
 *                          max_payload value for udp flows
 *                         (instead of just the first packet)
 *
 * @param udp_uniflow_port If not 0, then this will enable exporting a single
 *                         UDP packet with this src/dst port as a flow.
 *
 * @param pcap_dir      Directory to put pcap-per-flow files
 *
 * @param pcap_meta_file File for pcap meta output. Default is stdout
 *
 * @param max_pcap      Maximum size [in bytes] of a pcap file before rotating.
 *
 * @param pcap_per_flow If TRUE, then pcap_dir will be set to the directory
 *                      to place pcap-per-flow files.
 * @param force_read_all If TRUE, then yaf will process files that are out of
 *                       sequence.
 * @param stats_mode     If TRUE, then YAF will do some extra calculations
 *                       on flows.
 * @param index_pcap     If TRUE, print one line per packet we export. This
 *                       will give offset and length into the pcap yaf writes.
 *
 * @return a new flow table.
