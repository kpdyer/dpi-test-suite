/**
 * @mainpage YAF Core Library
 *
 * @section Introduction
 *
 * The YAF Core Library (libyaf) provides YAF file and stream I/O primitives
 * for reading and writing YAF bidirectional flow data in IPFIX files and via
 * the IPFIX protocol. It also provides packet decode, fragment reassembly,
 * and flow generation routines for YAF.
 *
 * yafcore.h provides the YAF I/O interface. The packet decode interface is
 * defined in decode.h. The fragment reassembly interface is defined in
 * yafrag.h, and the flow generator interface is defined in yaftab.h.
 *
 * picq.h defines a generic pickable queue used in fragment reassembly and
 * flow generation.
 *
 * Note that the fragment reassembler and decode interfaces have changed
 * dramatically from YAF 0.6.0 and earlier releases; the fragment reassembler
 * is no longer generic, to support higher performance decode and IPv4/IPv6
 * decode and fragment and flow assembly.
 *
 * @section Building
 *
 * The YAF Core Library is automatically built and installed as part of the
 * YAF installation process.
 *
 * @section Copyright
 * YAF is copyright 2006-2012 Carnegie Mellon University, and is released
 * under the GNU General Public License.  See the COPYING file in the
 * distribution for details.
 *
 * YAF was developed at the CERT Network Situational Awareness Group by
 * Brian Trammell and the CERT Network Situational Awareness Group Engineering
 * Team.
